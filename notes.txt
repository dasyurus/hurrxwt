Compilation is straightforward:
hipcc -O3 -o yourexecutable ../main.cpp ../csv.cpp --offload-arch=yourarchitecture

For 7900XTX use gfx1100 as your architecture.

And to run
./yourexecutable outputname

Be careful with the size of your lat_range and lon_range; there is no safety to stop code if it may be too large.
But it should be obvious in the results if it's too large.

This code should be easily runnable on Nvidia devices by replacing all hip* calls with cuda* calls.
